# üßÆ Simple Calculator

## Description
The **Simple Calculator** is a straightforward Java program that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to input two integers and select an arithmetic operation to execute. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations, making it a handy tool for quick calculations.

## üåü Features
- **Addition:** Computes the sum of two integers.
- **Subtraction:** Computes the difference between two integers.
- **Multiplication:** Computes the product of two integers.
- **Division:** Computes the quotient of two integers and gracefully handles division by zero.
- **Modulus:** Computes the remainder of the division of two integers, with division by zero handled gracefully.

## üöÄ Usage
1. **Run the Program:** Execute the `Calculator` class in your Java environment.
2. **Input Values:**
   - **First Integer:** Enter the first integer when prompted with `"Enter the value of num1:"`.
   - **Second Integer:** Enter the second integer when prompted with `"Enter the value of num2:"`.
   - **Operation Selection:** Choose an arithmetic operation by entering one of the following symbols when prompted with `"Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, %):"`:
     - `+` for addition
     - `-` for subtraction
     - `*` for multiplication
     - `/` for division
     - `%` for modulus
3. **View Results:** The program will display the result of the selected operation:
   - **Addition:** Shows the sum of the two integers.
   - **Subtraction:** Shows the difference between the two integers.
   - **Multiplication:** Shows the product of the two integers.
   - **Division:** Shows the quotient of the two integers. If dividing by zero, an error message will be displayed.
   - **Modulus:** Shows the remainder of the division. If dividing by zero, an error message will be displayed.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter two integers and select an arithmetic operation.
2. **Operation Execution:** Based on the selected operation, the program performs the calculation.
3. **Error Handling:** If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program handles the error gracefully by displaying an appropriate message.
4. **Output:** The result of the operation is displayed on the console.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used to implement the calculator's functionality.
