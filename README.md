Simple Calculator

Description
This Java program is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to input two integers and select an arithmetic operation to perform. The supported operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The calculator then displays the result of the selected operation.

Features
Addition: Computes the sum of two integers.
Subtraction: Computes the difference between two integers.
Multiplication: Computes the product of two integers.
Division: Computes the quotient of two integers. Handles division by zero gracefully.
Modulus: Computes the remainder of the division of two integers. Handles division by zero gracefully.
Usage
Run the Program: Execute the Calculator class.

Input Values:

Enter the first integer when prompted with "Enter the value of num1: ".
Enter the second integer when prompted with "Enter the value of num2: ".
Enter the desired operation (+, -, *, /, %) when prompted with "Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, %): ".
View Results: The program will display the result of the selected operation.

Addition: Shows the sum of the two integers.
Subtraction: Shows the difference between the two integers.
Multiplication: Shows the product of the two integers.
Division: Shows the quotient of the two integers. If dividing by zero, an error message is displayed.
Modulus: Shows the remainder of the division. If dividing by zero, an error message is displayed.
